This game, written in C++ using the ncurses library, challenges players to navigate a car against the flow of traffic.
The objective is to avoid oncoming vehicles and obstacles while progressing through increasingly difficult levels.
The game features simple graphics and intuitive controls, making it both engaging and accessible.
The project serves as an excellent example of using ncurses for game development in C++,
demonstrating key concepts such as real-time input handling,collision detection, and dynamic screen updates.
